Algorithms on C# programming language!


- Permutation: Given a smaller string 'str' and a bigger string 'text'. Design an algorithm to find all permutations of the shorter string within the longer one. Solution: Algorithms->Permutation->StringPermutation.cs
  - Time complexity: O(N) where N = text.Length

- Find all pairs with sum k within an array. Solution: Algorithms->Sums->PairSum.cs
  - Time complexity: O(N) where N = array.Length
